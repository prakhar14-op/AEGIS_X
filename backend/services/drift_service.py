"""
Detects behavioral drift using Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) change-point detection.

Pipeline position:
    Similarity Score → History Buffer → **CUSUM Detector** → Drift Alert

CUSUM Algorithm:
    S(t) = S(t-1) + (deviation - allowance)
    where deviation = expected_similarity - actual_similarity

    When S(t) exceeds the threshold → DRIFT DETECTED

    The 'allowance' parameter (k) prevents false alarms from normal variance.
    The 'threshold' parameter (h) controls sensitivity:
        Lower threshold = more sensitive (catches subtle drift earlier)
        Higher threshold = more robust (fewer false positives)

class CUSUMDetector:
    """
    Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) change-point detector for behavioral drift.

    Maintains a cumulative sum of deviations from expected similarity.
    When small deviations accumulate consistently in one direction,
    CUSUM detects the trend long before individual scores would trigger alerts.

    Two detection modes:
    1. GRADUAL DRIFT: CUSUM accumulates over many steps (account takeover)
       - Attacker behavior slowly diverges from victim's baseline
       - Individual steps may look innocent, but the trend is clear
       - CUSUM catches it after ~5-10 steps of consistent decay

    2. SUDDEN JUMP: Instant similarity collapse (malware/screen mirroring)
       - Single step drops similarity from 0.95 → 0.40
       - Detected immediately by the instant_jump_threshold
       - No accumulation needed — it's catastrophic on its own

    Parameters tuned against Phase 1 synthetic data:
        - Normal user variance: similarity ∈ [0.95, 0.999] (σ ≈ 0.01)
        - Account takeover end-state: similarity ∈ [0.85, 0.90]
        - Malware instant state: similarity ∈ [0.80, 0.87]
